<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micropiles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cased Type</li><li>Uncased Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The micropiles market is divided into two main types: cased and uncased micropiles. Cased types involve the installation of a steel casing to provide structural integrity and enhance load-bearing capacity, often used in challenging soil conditions. Uncased micropiles, on the other hand, rely solely on the grout for stability and are typically installed in less complex geological settings. Both types are integral in foundation support, slope stabilization, and retrofitting applications, catering to diverse construction needs.</p></p>
