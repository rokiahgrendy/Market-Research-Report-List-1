<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Enzyme Replacement Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injectable Agents</li><li>Oral Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) includes two primary market types: injectable agents and oral agents. Injectable agents are typically proteins administered via subcutaneous or intravenous routes, allowing for direct absorption and immediate systemic effects, crucial for managing severe enzyme deficiencies. In contrast, oral agents are designed for oral administration, offering convenience and improved patient adherence, although they may face challenges in absorption and bioavailability. Both types aim to replenish deficient enzymes and improve quality of life for patients with metabolic disorders.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Enzyme Replacement Therapy Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gaucher Disease</li><li>Fabry Disease</li><li>MPS Disease</li><li>Gastrointestinal Disease</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) predominantly targets lysosomal storage diseases, providing therapeutic enzymes that are deficient or absent. In Gaucher Disease, ERT helps alleviate symptoms by replenishing glucocerebrosidase. Fabry Disease benefits similarly, with ERT addressing alpha-galactosidase A deficiency. Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) Disease treatments focus on replacing enzymes for better glycosaminoglycan metabolism. ERT is also applied in gastrointestinal diseases due to enzyme deficiencies impacting digestion and absorption. The “Others” category encompasses additional conditions where enzyme supplementation aids in restoring biological function.</p></p>
