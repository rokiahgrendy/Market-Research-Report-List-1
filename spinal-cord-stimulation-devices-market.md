<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Cord Stimulation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rechargeable SCS</li><li>Non-Rechargeable SCS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal cord stimulation (SCS) devices market is divided into two main types: rechargeable SCS and non-rechargeable SCS. Rechargeable SCS devices feature an internal battery that can be recharged via an external charger, offering longer-lasting power and reduced replacement frequency. Non-rechargeable SCS devices, on the other hand, have a fixed battery life and typically require surgical replacement once depleted. Both types are used to manage chronic pain, with options tailored to patient preferences and lifestyle considerations.</p></p>
